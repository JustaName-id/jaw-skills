description: Best practices and usage guide for the JAW SDK (@jaw.id/core, @jaw.id/wagmi, @jaw.id/ui). Use this skill when writing code that uses jaw-sdk or @jaw.id packages, integrating JAW smart accounts into an application, configuring JAW SDK features (passkeys, permissions, gas sponsoring, ENS), building with JAW wagmi hooks, implementing headless/server-side smart account operations, debugging JAW SDK issues, or when asked about JAW SDK patterns, APIs, or best practices.

# JAW SDK Best Practices

Guide for building applications with the JAW SDK passkey-authenticated smart accounts on EVM chains with programmable permissions.

## When to use

Reference these guidelines when:

- Installing or setting up `@jaw.id/wagmi`, `@jaw.id/core`, or `@jaw.id/ui`
- Configuring the JAW connector or provider (API key, modes, paymasters, ENS)
- Connecting/disconnecting wallets with passkey authentication
- Sending transactions (single or batched) through JAW smart accounts
- Signing messages or typed data (EIP-191, EIP-712, ERC-7871)
- Granting, querying, or revoking permissions (ERC-7715)
- Implementing subscription payments or recurring charges
- Setting up gas sponsoring with paymasters (ERC-7677)
- Issuing ENS subnames to users during onboarding
- Implementing Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE)
- Building headless integrations, server-side operations, or AI agent wallets
- Using the Account class directly (no UI)
- Building stablecoin payment flows (USDC gas, batch payouts)
- Choosing between CrossPlatform and AppSpecific authentication modes
- Implementing a custom UI handler for app-specific mode
- Reviewing or debugging code that uses JAW SDK

## Key facts

- **Packages:** `@jaw.id/wagmi` (React), `@jaw.id/core` (vanilla JS / server), `@jaw.id/ui` (app-specific mode UI)
- **API Key:** Required. Get one at [https://dashboard.jaw.id](https://dashboard.jaw.id)
- **EIP-1193 compatible:** Drop-in replacement for MetaMask or any wallet
- **Smart accounts:** ERC-4337 with passkey signers, gasless tx, batch ops, permissions
- **EntryPoint:** v0.8 only (for paymasters)
