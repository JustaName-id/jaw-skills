### Company boilerplate

**Short (1 sentence):**
> JustaLab builds JAW.id — smart account infrastructure with passkey authentication, ENS identity, and programmable permissions for any app.

**Medium (2 sentences):**
> JustaLab builds JAW.id, a unified SDK that gives any application self-custodial smart accounts with passkey onboarding, gasless transactions, and programmable permissions — in two lines of code. JustaLab is also the team behind JustaName, an official ENS infrastructure provider for programmable digital identity.

**Long (paragraph):**
> JustaLab is building the infrastructure layer for the next generation of onchain accounts. Its flagship product, JAW.id, provides smart account infrastructure that replaces 12–18 months of wallet development with a single SDK integration. Users onboard with a fingerprint, receive a human-readable ENS identity, and get a self-custodial smart account with gasless transactions, batch operations, AI agent delegation, and programmable permissions. JustaLab is also behind JustaName, an official ENS infrastructure provider, and has been backed by an ENS grant since Q2 2025. The team includes founding members of Axiom Zen / Dapper Labs (inventors of NFTs), architects of major crypto custody platforms, and enterprise strategy leaders.

### Talk abstracts

Use these as starting points. Customize the title and abstract for the specific conference's audience and theme.

#### Abstract 1: The Three Eras of Onchain Wallets (Technical / Thought Leadership)

**Title options:**
- "From Seed Phrases to Smart Accounts: The Natural Evolution of Onchain Wallets"
- "Account = Key Is the Problem: Why Smart Accounts Are Inevitable"
- "The Permission Layer Is the Real Frontier"

**Abstract:**
> The wallet industry has spent years optimizing how to split, store, and reconstitute a 32-byte private key. But the real problem isn't key management — it's that the account model fuses identity with access. This talk traces the evolution from seed phrases (self-custody, terrible UX) through KMS embedded wallets (great UX, structural custody limitations) to smart accounts with passkeys (both, plus a programmable permission layer). We'll examine why the shift from "how do we protect the key?" to "what is this key allowed to do?" changes everything — from AI agent delegation to enterprise adoption to subscription payments. With live demonstrations of passkey-authenticated smart accounts, onchain permissions, and agent delegation.

**Best for:** Developer conferences, Ethereum-focused events, account abstraction tracks.

#### Abstract 2: AI Agents Need Wallets They Can't Drain (Applied / Forward-Looking)

**Title options:**
- "AI Agents Need Wallets They Can't Drain"
- "Programmable Permissions for the Agent Economy"
- "Why AI Agents Can't Use Your Bank Account (And What They Need Instead)"

**Abstract:**
> AI agents are becoming autonomous economic actors — paying for compute, executing trades, managing portfolios. But agents can't do KYC, can't open bank accounts, and humans shouldn't hand over payment cards to autonomous software. Smart accounts with programmable permissions solve this: grant an agent constrained authority (spending limits, whitelisted contracts, time bounds) and let the account enforce the rules onchain. This talk covers the architecture of agent-compatible accounts, real-world delegation patterns (DCA bots, trading copilots, service payments), and why the permission layer — not the key — is the real security boundary. With live demos of granting, executing within, and revoking agent permissions.

**Best for:** AI/ML conferences, fintech events, crossover AI + crypto tracks.

#### Abstract 3: Two Lines of Code to Smart Accounts (Developer / Practical)

**Title options:**
- "Smart Accounts in Two Lines of Code"
- "Drop-In Smart Accounts for Wagmi Developers"
- "From MetaMask to Smart Accounts Without Changing Your Hooks"

**Abstract:**
> You already use wagmi. You already use `useSendTransaction` and `useSignMessage`. What if your users could have passkey-authenticated smart accounts — with gasless transactions, batch operations, and programmable permissions — without changing a single hook? This talk is a live coding walkthrough: adding smart account support to an existing wagmi app, configuring gas sponsoring, issuing ENS identities at onboarding, granting permissions for AI agent delegation, and implementing subscription payments. Practical, code-first, and immediately applicable.

**Best for:** Developer workshops, hackathon kickoffs, Web3 builder tracks.

### Booth and collateral copy

**Banner headline options:**
- "Smart Accounts. Two Lines of Code."
- "Web2 Simplicity. Web3 Sovereignty."
- "Identity-First Smart Accounts."

**Handout one-pager structure:**
1. Headline: "Replace 12–18 months of wallet development with one SDK."

>
> **Format:** 90-minute hands-on workshop
>
> **Description:** Participants will build a working app with passkey-authenticated smart accounts, gasless transactions, and ENS identity using the JAW SDK and wagmi. Starting from a standard Next.js template, they'll integrate the JAW connector, configure gas sponsoring, issue ENS subnames, and implement permission-based features (AI agent delegation or subscription payments). All participants leave with a deployed app.
>
> **What we provide:** API keys for all participants, documentation access, live technical support, prizes for best integrations.

### Common mistakes

- Do NOT submit the same abstract to every conference — customize the title and framing for each event's audience and theme.
- Do NOT use internal jargon (TAM, moat, runway) in public-facing talk abstracts — save that for investor contexts.
- Do NOT forget to mention the team's Dapper Labs / NFT heritage — it's the strongest credibility signal for crypto-native conferences.
- Do NOT make the talk abstract a product pitch — position it as thought leadership or practical education. The product demonstrates itself through the content.
- Do NOT use "Web3" in talk titles for mainstream tech conferences — use "smart accounts," "programmable permissions," or describe the capability directly.
- Do NOT skip the live demo angle — "with live demonstrations" significantly increases acceptance rates for technical talks.
