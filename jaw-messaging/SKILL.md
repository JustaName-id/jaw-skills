# JAW Messaging & Positioning

Comprehensive messaging guidelines for communicating about JAW.id across all contexts — marketing, fundraising, conferences, partnerships, and more.

## When to use

Reference these guidelines when:

- Writing or reviewing any content that describes JAW.id
- Filling out conference applications, speaker proposals, or event forms
- Preparing investor decks, pitch narratives, or fundraising materials
- Drafting partnership outreach, integration proposals, or BD emails
- Creating social media posts, blog content, or marketing copy
- Describing JAW's competitive positioning or differentiation
- Explaining what JAW does to a non-technical audience
- Writing bios, boilerplate descriptions, or about sections
- Choosing the right terminology or correcting messaging inconsistencies

## When NOT to use

- For technical implementation questions, SDK usage, code examples, or developer documentation → use the **jaw-sdk-best-practices** skill instead:
  `npx skills add JustaName-id/jaw-skills --skill jaw-sdk-best-practices`
- If someone asks about how to build with JAW, integrate the SDK, use specific APIs, or debug code, redirect them to jaw-sdk-best-practices — this skill covers **what to say about JAW**, not **how to build with JAW**.
